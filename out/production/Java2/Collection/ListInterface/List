List Interface in Java is a way to store Ordered collection.
It is an Ordered Collection of objects in which duplicate values can be stored.
List Interface is found in java.util package and inherits the Collection interface.


ArrayList Class :
The ArrayList class provides the implementation of the List interface.
The ArrayList class allows you to create a resizable array, it size increases dramatically when more element are added.
ArrayList proves to be more efficient in searching an object in the list and inserting the object at the end of the list.


LinkedList Class :
The LinkedList Class provides the implementation of the List interface.
The LinkedList Class enables you to create a doubly-linked list.
The doubly-linked list is a set of sequentially linked records called nodes,
where each node contains two links that are the references of the previous node, and the next node in the sequence,
respectively.
LinkedList can be traversed in the forward or backward direction,
LinkedList proves to be efficient in insertion and deletion of objects from the list.


Vector Class :
The Vector class is similar to the ArrayList and LinkedList classes.
However, the methods of the Vector class are synchronized.
which means that only one thread at a given time can access it in a multithreaded environment.
On the other hand, the method of the ArrayList and LinkedList are not synchronized
